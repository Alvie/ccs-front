<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>I am studying abroad at the University of Vienna, and I think I should take the opportunity to speak about Monero around Europe at local cryptocurrency meetups. This is the first proposal of what I hope to be many, depending on the success of this one. Since I have a lot of free time in Europe, I would love to speak about Monero in many cities. This proposal is just for four, two of which are free to this community.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/vbotecom/status/842305872856514560">Valencia</a>: March 15th (not collecting donations; was on vacation)</p>

<p>Graz: March 27th (graciously paid for by <a href="https://www.meetup.com/BlockchainHub-Graz/events/238204566/">BlockchainHub Graz</a>)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Group-Zagreb/events/238616297/">Zagreb</a>: April 3rd (asking for reimbursement)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/BlockchainGreece-0/events/236892446/">Athens</a>: April 28th (asking for reimbursement)</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/Bitcoin-Generation-Roma/events/238585056/">Rome</a>: May 27th (asking for reimbursement)</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>I have been an active contributor in the Monero community for two years now. While the best program I wrote was for my calculator, I have worked to contribute to the Monero project in several other ways. <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/98617?phase=beta&amp;users=mostactive#tab-top">I am among the most active StackExchange users on the Monero site</a>, I am a moderator on the /r/MoneroMining subreddit, and I have spoken about Monero <a href="http://imgur.com/a/XbMuX">several</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/a/xyUKc">times</a> at my home university. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Ye85G">I am a president</a> of the <a href="https://forum.getmonero.org/22/completed-tasks/87610/www.cryptoumn.com">University of Minnesota Cryptocurrency Club</a>, and we have approximately 50 active members. When I am back in the states, our group typically has two meetings a month, and I play a large role in the meeting presentations. Although I am interested in several cryptocurrencies, Monero has received the majority of my time and effort outside of the club's efforts.</p>

<p>I am working with other groups to speak in Athens, Rome, Budapest, Edinburgh, Dublin, Cologne, Warsaw, Paris, Riga, Oslo, Stockholm, and others. If this is successful, expect talks in many other cities. I am purposefully avoiding speaking at places that Riccardo Spagni has already spoken at to increase the reach of these talks.</p>

<p>The meeting will cover the history of privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin, discuss several approaches to the problems, and discuss how Monero achieves its privacy in detail. I will discuss the next steps in development going forward and limitations compared to other coins. It will be similar to Riccardo Spagni's speeches, but I have tried to make the presentation my own. The Valencia speech was very similar to Riccardo's, and I hope to make some improvements to my presentation before the Graz and Zagreb meetups. My speeches are in English.</p>

<p>I am speaking about Monero, but I will not function as a "salesperson" for the currency. I will address the work in progress with Monero and the drawbacks it has compared to some other coins. While I definitely do not want to make the presentation strictly a comparison of coins, I want to make it clear that I will try to give the most factual information about Monero. I am doing these speeches to raise awareness of Monero, not to trick people into buying some.</p>

<h3 id="funding-structure">Funding Structure</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I am not being paid to speak at this location.</li>
  <li>Flight and hotel search was completed with Google Flights and Google, respectively.</li>
  <li>If the proposal is over-funded, I would suggest that a reasonable amount is used for food costs (~$25). If the price of Monero falls suddenly before the trip, the extra amount will make up the difference in dollars. I am okay taking a slight loss, but I cannot afford to carry out future proposals if the value of Monero falls by a large amount. This decision is ultimately up to the moderators.</li>
  <li>Flights are the cheapest I could find that fit in the available time window. Some exceptions may be made to substantially shorten travel time or layovers. Hotels are basic and 2 or 3-star.</li>
  <li>In some instances, I will take a train or a bus if it saves time and/or money. For instance, I plan on taking a train to Budapest to save money. To get to Zagreb, the train routes are not as direct, and a bus would take many hours. That's why I am taking a flight to Zagreb this time.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="costs-breakdown">Costs Breakdown</h3>

<p>Zagreb Flight (round trip): $256</p>

<p>Zagreb Hotel (2 nights): $120</p>

<p>Transportation to/from airports: $40</p>

<p>Athens Flight (round trip): $280</p>

<p>Athens Hotel (2 nights): $130</p>

<p>Transportation to/from airports: $40</p>

<p>Rome Flight (round trip): $160</p>

<p>Rome Hotel (3 nights): $245</p>

<p>Transportation to/from arports: $40</p>

<p>Total: $1311 (66 XMR)</p>

<p>I got excited and booked my flights and hotels before this gets funded. Thus, I am going to speak at these locations whether this proposal gets funded or not.</p>
